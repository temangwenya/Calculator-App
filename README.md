# Calculator-App 🧮
This project is originally a basic calculator, but will eventually evolve into one that can also store user data.


____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## 📌 Overview

  This is a simple calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
  The goal is to start with a basic calculator and then expand it into a more advanced version that supports:
  
  * 🔐 User login
  * 💾 Saving user data (calculation history)
  * 🗄️ Backend integration with **MySQL**
  
  This project is part of my learning journey in **frontend and backend web development**.
